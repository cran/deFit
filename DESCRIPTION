Description: Use numerical optimization to fit ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to time series data to examine the dynamic relationships between variables or the characteristics of a dynamical system. It can now be used to estimate the parameters of ODEs up to second order, and can also apply to multilevel systems. See <https://github.com/yueqinhu/defit> for details.
